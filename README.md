# Welcome to Wordle!
Your job is to guess the hidden word. Start by putting a random word. The letters will get one of the following colors:
- Green - the letter is in the right spot! Good job!
- Yellow - the letter is in the hidden word but not in that spot,
- Purple - the letter is not in the hidden word.

If you got most of the letters right, you may try to guess. If not, enter another word. It is a good idea to try a word containing as many different letters from the first one as possible. If you succeed the whole window will get a green overlay. When you use the maximum number of guesses (that number depends on the chosen difficulty), the window will get a red overlay and the correct word will be displayed.

The word you guess is entered only if it occurs in the dictionary. The sample dictionary with some Polish and English words is given in the 'Wordle.txt' file.

You can choose between different difficulties. Harder difficulty will allow you to take more guesses but it requiers more words to be guessed at the same time. For example choosing hard difficulty opens four game windows and each of them has a different hidden word but when you guess a word it is entered in each window. It would be a good idea to look at the keyboard window which also has the letters painted according to their occurance in the games.

After you finish you can click on any difficulty to restart the game.
